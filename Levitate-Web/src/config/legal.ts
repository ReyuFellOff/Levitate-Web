    title:   'Privacy Policy',
    summary: 'This Privacy Policy explains what information Levitate ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects when you use the Bot on Discord or visit this website, why we collect it, and how you can control it.',
    sections: [

        heading: '1. Information We Collect',
        intro:   'Levitate is a Discord bot, and the information it processes comes almost entirely from Discord\'s own platform and the servers you add it to. We collect and store only what is needed to provide the features you and your server enable.',
        clauses: [
          'Discord identifiers: user IDs, server (guild) IDs, channel IDs, and role IDs, used to associate settings and data with the correct account or server.',
          'Server configuration: prefixes, log channel settings, autorole rules, sticky messages, autoresponder triggers, welcomer and birthday configuration, antinuke module settings, and similar settings you configure with commands.',
          'User-submitted content: warnings issued by moderators, saved message/embed/CV2 payloads created with data commands, birthdays you set, aliases you create, and AFK statuses/messages.',
          'Moderation records: bans, kicks, timeouts, and warnings carried out through the Bot, including the reason text provided by the moderator.',
          'Command usage metadata: which commands are run, in which server, and when. Used for rate-limiting, debugging, and abuse prevention. We do not log full command arguments beyond what is needed to operate the feature.',
          'Message content: only processed transiently for features that require it (e.g. autoresponders, sticky messages, snipe/reaction-snipe, purge filters). Message content is not permanently stored unless a server explicitly enables message logging with `$log message`, and even then only metadata and, where necessary, the message content relevant to the logged event is kept.',
          'Website usage: the landing page itself does not use tracking cookies or third-party analytics. Standard web server logs (IP address, user agent, request timestamp) may be retained briefly by our hosting provider for security and abuse prevention.',
